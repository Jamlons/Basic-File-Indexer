Known Issues:

When giving the filelist '*' - error returned will be Unexpected end of file. This currently causes no issues. Although when looking online this may have to do with our testing data.
Additionally this error doesn't occur 100% of the time, but more likely then not it occurs.
However the issue doesn't change the outcome of our program.

When adding '&' as a filename - Program freezes
