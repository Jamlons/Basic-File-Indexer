"The Dead in the Classroom," by Stephen Rushen.

To an early morning freshman economics class of thirty live students,
fifteen dead students were added.  Performance of both live and dead
students was observed through the course of the semester.  Data are
presented in the categories of:  attendance; behavior; participation; and
exam scores.  In three of the four areas, the dead students' performance
was the equal of, if not superior to, that of their living peers.
